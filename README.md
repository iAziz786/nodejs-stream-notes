# Node.js Stream Notes

This repository is the notes that I have make while learning stream API of node effectively.

## So, what is stream exactly?
According to wikipedia, a stream is a body of water with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of channel.

Well, probably not the answer what I was looking for.

But the analogy of the stream in computer science is quite the same. Instead of a "body of water" we can say some **chunks of data** which are being flowing from one memory space to another.
